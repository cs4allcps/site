# Our new Hugo powered site (under construction)

To localhost the site, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) and run 
```
hugo server
```
in Terminal. To view full site with draft pages (currently the only page marked as draft is the new staff page, but this feature will come in handy when we're updating the site while it's live), run
```
hugo server --buildDrafts
```

I'll update the README later with more detailed intructions for making changes to the site along with some notable other info like shortcodes I've made to extend the functionality of Markdown.
