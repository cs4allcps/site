<h1 id="parents">Parents</h1>

<p>The role of the parent in a students computer science education is extremely important. You play a large role in the courses your students take, the after school activities they participate in, and the community that is created and maintained at your school. By taking the time understand computer science and the importance of computer science education and actively supporting the efforts of computer science education you can help become a part of the not only your child&rsquo;s education but also the CS4All movement here in Chicago. If your child gains support from, or is encouraged to take the first steps to begin experimenting with computing, they may begin down the path of computer science even earlier than high school.</p>

<p>To help break down computer science, take a look at what it can do for your child:</p>

</header>
<div>
Every industry is looking for computer scientists, and with an average starting salary of $58,000, according to Forbes, and have more jobs available than students to fill the openings, every computer science student is highly lucrative. Computer science provides students with the opportunity to pursue their technical passions while also having enough freedom to express their creativity through their platform of expression. Computer science is not limiting, by being able to adapt to all mediums and being applicable to all problem areas, students can apply the lessons that they have learned through computer science to anything that they wish.

<h2><a href="/parents/graduation-requirement/">Graduation Requirement</a><h2>
</header>
<div>
This past winter, our district instituted the first purely computer science graduation requirement in the nation. Starting with the graduating class of 2020, all high school students must take and pass at least one full-year computer science course.
The core high school courses consists of two offerings:
 Exploring Computer Science (ECS): This course was founded on a K-12/university partnership out of Los Angeles and aims to change the stereotypes around computer science, whether they be belief systems, political, or technical.

Our goal with CS4All is to ensure that students across the district are afforded the opportunity to receive world-class CS instruction, regardless of the type, size, or socioeconomic status of a school’s students. This policy is designed to encourage and motivate Chicago Public School students to pursue post-secondary preparation in the various fields of computer sciences. This policy is further intended to provide direction to schools for the inclusion of appropriate computer science instruction within the curriculum in all schools and grade levels.
