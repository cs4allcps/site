      <description>Every industry is looking for computer scientists, and with an average starting salary of $58,000, according to Forbes, and have more jobs available than students to fill the openings, every computer science student is highly lucrative. Computer science provides students with the opportunity to pursue their technical passions while also having enough freedom to express their creativity through their platform of expression. Computer science is not limiting, by being able to adapt to all mediums and being applicable to all problem areas, students can apply the lessons that they have learned through computer science to anything that they wish.</description>

      <description>Our goal with CS4All is to ensure that students across the district are afforded the opportunity to receive world-class CS instruction, regardless of the type, size, or socioeconomic status of a schoolâ€™s students. This policy is designed to encourage and motivate Chicago Public School students to pursue post-secondary preparation in the various fields of computer sciences. This policy is further intended to provide direction to schools for the inclusion of appropriate computer science instruction within the curriculum in all schools and grade levels.</description>
