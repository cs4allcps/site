<h3 id="support-cs4all-teachers">Support CS4All Teachers!</h3>

<p><em>The teachers of CS4All are the building blocks of the initiative, they are the reason that as a school district we are able to push computer science education forward. Our teachers have stood up and said that they realize the importance of computer science and know that our students deserve the opportunity to learn computer science and have taken it upon themselves to get educated in this new field. We have been able to help prepare and support our teachers along the way and we need your help to continue to do so.</em></p>

<p>Here is how you can choose to show your support:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support teacher certification - greater than 1 scholarship for teacher certification</li>
<li>PD (and food/refreshments in the summer or throughout the year) - for a cohort for the district</li>
<li>Event support - for 1 year and a minimum of one event (such as student hackathons, open houses, etc.)</li>

<li>Software - enough licenses for a school for at least 2+ years</li>
<li>Devices - enough for a class/cart</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="support-the-cs4all-initiative-directly">Support the CS4All Initiative Directly</h3>

By supporting the CS4All initiative directly you are supporting the whole district as we work to make Computer Science for All a reality.</em></p>
