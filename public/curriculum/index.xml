These resources, which are part of Appleâ€™s Everyone Can Code program, are aligned with core computer science themes, and are mapped to the relevant CSTA and ISTE Computer Science standards. Below is a description of the range of resources available that take students all the way from no coding experience to building their first apps.</description>
