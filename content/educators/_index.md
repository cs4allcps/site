Teachers are one of the most important resources a student has. We value each of our teachers and feel that it is extremely important to make sure that every CS4All teacher feels adequately prepared to teach computer science. Teachers are the vehicle to help spread the message of computer science throughout the district by educating students and showing others what amazing things kids can do with computer science by displaying projects, images, videos, etc.  We know that our teachers are just as knowledgable as we are when it comes to what are students want and need; they know how our curriculum can and should be delivered. We look to our educators to educate and advise us on best practices.
