+++

CS4All encourages educators to network and share their knowledge and expertise when it comes to the curricula and different teaching materials, tools, and resources that they find useful. We have assembled a Teacher Advisory Council of highly experienced and active CS4All teachers who are available to act as resources not only to the the CS4All team members but also to other teachers and administrators in the district. This council will be available to offer advice on curriculum development, framework development, new student outreach and engagement plans, and much more.

To learn more about the Council, how to get in contact with them, or how to join, please contact us at [cs4all@cps.edu](mailto:cs4all@cps.edu) with *"Teacher Advisory Board"* in the subject.
