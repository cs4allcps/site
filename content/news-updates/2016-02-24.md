On February 24, 2016 the Chicago Board of Education unanimously **approved the addition of computer science as a graduation requirement** for all Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students beginning with next year's freshmen, the class of 2020. CPS has become a national leader in computer science education since Mayor Rahm Emanuel launched the Computer Science for All (CS4All) initiative for grades K-12 in December 2013.

After CPS launched the CS4All initiative in 2013, several large urban districts have replicated a curriculum and model similar to Chicago's. In doing so, CPS became the first school district in the country to elevate computer science as a core requirement for high school, separate from math and science. Recognizing Chicago's success, the White House launched a national CS4All initiative earlier this month.
