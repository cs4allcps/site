This past winter, our district instituted the first purely computer science graduation requirement in the nation. Starting with the graduating class of 2020, all high school students must take and pass at least one full-year computer science course.

The core high school courses consists of two offerings:

* **Exploring Computer Science (ECS):** This course was founded on a K-12/university partnership out of Los Angeles and aims to change the stereotypes around computer science, whether they be belief systems, political, or technical. It aims to serves underrepresented communities who may not otherwise participate in computer science and to do so through inquiry based instruction.
* **AP Computer Science Principles (CSP):** This course is designed to be more rigorous and have more advanced material than ECS and is a good option for students who have already taken ECS. It is a new Advanced Placement course designed to give students foundational computing skills, an understanding of the real-world impact of computing applications, and programming literacy. It is a course seeking to broaden participation in computing and computer science by students who might not otherwise consider studying the subject.
