If you would like to learn more about the work that CS4All is doing inside of CPS and how you can involved through more hands on volunteering and participation there are several opportunities and organizations that have created opportunities for you to do so. Additionally CS4All is an initiative that thrives off of parent and community involvement, through your involvement in student computer science education students will be even more encouraged to pursue his or her path in computing. These opportunities are a few of the ways that you can get involved locally with CS4All:

* Volunteer or donate to a non-profit computer science organization such as [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/), [Girls Who Code](http://girlswhocode.com/), [Blue1647](http://www.blue1647.com/)
* Do an activity on [code.org](http://code.org/) to get hands on experience with the activities that students are doing
