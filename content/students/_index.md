Computer Science for All seeks to create equal computing access and education for all students in Chicago. Within the next 10 years, we are projecting to expand computer science to all the schools in our district, impacting our students from kindergarten through twelfth grade and beyond. Currently, all incoming high school students must graduate with at least one credit of computer science. Our department also works with many city partners to insure that resources are available to schools and students inside of and outside of the classroom to pursue their computer science studies beyond this one credit requirement.
