title = "Student Advisory Board"

+++

The Student Advisory Board was created by CS4All to provide a student perspective on the CS4All curriculum and the student’s learning environment in order to help the CS4All team work on improving both for future computer science students. The board consists of a diverse group of approximately 10 - 15 high school students who represent various areas of the city (south, west, north) and school types (including charter and option schools) who are selected through an open application process each year. The application is based on his or her vision and passion for creating change, rationale for wanting to join the Board, unique perspective they would bring to the Board, and past service to community and/or school. Each student member of the Board has participated in at least on computer science course prior to their participation on the Board in order to effectively offer input on the computer science curriculum created offered through CS4All. Whether they have taken the introductory Exploring Computer Science course, Fundamentals of Info Tech, STEM Intro to Comp Sci, or the Advanced Placement CS Principles course, they have been exposed to what CS4All can do. As a student who has seen what benefits can come from learning about computational thinking, it is important that these students help us develop new ways to improve the curricula that they have experienced so that we can provide students like them with access to even more advanced technology and computer science fundamentals in the classroom.

## Recommendations

| Recommendation | Progress |
---|---
| Hour of Code needs to be adapted to better suit the needs of every student. There should be recommendations and resources available post activity/day of event. | |
|We also need to begin to focus on the important role a parent plays in a student's involvement in computing; through Hour of Code events after school and/or on the weekends that invite parents to program with their kids and by having professionals speak about career opportunity parents can become more engaged in their child's interests. | The Student Advisory Board is currently giving feedback on this year's planning of the Hour of Code. |
| For students, we also need to acknowledge that there is varying experience level in those who participate in the Hour of Code by introducing a gamified element that invities students to create the "coolest game or app" or by introducing new platforms for students to use after they have completed an activity. | |
