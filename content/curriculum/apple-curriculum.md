If your school has recent Apple hardware available, we endorse the free K-12 teaching and learning resources from Apple. These resources, which are part of Appleâ€™s Everyone Can Code program, are aligned with core computer science themes, and are mapped to the relevant CSTA and ISTE Computer Science standards. Below is a description of the range of resources available that take students all the way from no coding experience to building their first apps.

### Coding Resources for Elementary Schools on iPad

The Get Started with Code teacher guides help teachers bring coding into the classroom using visual-based programming apps like CodeSpark Academy and Tynker. The teacher guides include activities, reflection questions, journal prompts, and more to help teach coding concepts and apply them in everyday contexts.

### Coding Resources for Middle Schools on iPad

The Swift Playgrounds iPad app includes built-in lessons designed to teach students fundamental coding concepts. Students use real Swift code - the same code professional developers use every day - to solve puzzles and guide a character through a 3D world. And the Learn to Code teacher guides help teachers bring Swift Playgrounds into the classroom, no matter their level of coding experience.

### App Development Resources for High Schools on Mac

The Intro to App Development with Swift course teaches students with little or no programming experience how two build their first iOS app. This one-semester course introduces students to Swift and Xcode and helps students build a solid foundation in programming fundamentals. The teacher guide provides additional activities, discussion questions, and prompts for an app design journal.
