Computer Science for All has received several grants since the conception of the initiative. Each of these grants has played an extremely important role in propelling the CS4All initiative forward in Chicago. 


**CME Group** has provided a grant to CS4All in order to support our efforts of significantly improving STEM educational offerings within CPS. Our mutual hope is that by giving students a quality introduction to computing in their younger years, we will better prepare them for 21st-century global society participation. Through this grant we are:

* Working to introduce CS into at least 25% of CPS elementary schools in the next 5 years
* Developing a K-8 CS coaching model
* Developing a K-8 master teacher model
* Developing a CS university teaching assistant model

**Accelerate ECS4ALL** is a grant sponsored by the National Science Foundation which was awarded to CS4All for our focus on two main critical needs:

* Strengthening (new to Exploring Computer Science) teacher support through the creation of an integrated, scalable model of peer coaching
* Complementing the CS4All efforts to continue to increase the cadre of teachers prepared to effectively teach Exploring Computer Science (and eventually CS Principles) with the goal of being able to serve every high school in CPS. 

**Validate ECS4ALL** is a grant sponsored by the National Science Foundation which was awarded to CS4All for research on the question “How do the components of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) course work together to equitably inspire students to pursue further computer science coursework?” The two questions that are being investigated by CS4All to provide evidence on the extent to which this goal is achieved are:

1. Does the quality of ECS implementation influence the probability that female and minority students will pursue and succeed in further computer science coursework in high school?
2. How do the components of ECS work together to contribute towards the probability that female and minority students will pursue and succeed in further computer science coursework in high school?

**The Broadening Advanced Technological Education Connections (BATEC) Grant** is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and was awarded to CS4All based on our matched efforts and mission in advancing information technology curriculum, outreach, and research to reflect the demands of the 21st century workplace. The mission of BATEC is:

* Defining and strengthening academic pathways and career opportunities in the disciplines of Computing and Information Technologies (Computer Science, Information Technology, Web Technologies, Networking, Big Data).
* Facilitating strategic and collaborative partnerships between academic partners and local industry representatives in order to build awareness, generate interest, and support learning opportunities in ethnically diverse urban areas.
* Conducting and publishing actionable research to inform policy makers, IT educators, and employers on the subjects of integrated curriculum and workforce development.
