+++

CPS teachers can access our resource repository, a Google Drive folder where our teachers have added resources they have created, especially lesson plans for CS curricula.

**[Access it here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6Ztxt-q19ODd21uZmJjTGp2U3M?usp=sharing)**

Due to CPS' current sharing policy, the folder is only accessible within the CPS Google Apps domain.
