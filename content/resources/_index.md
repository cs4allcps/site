# Resources

Connections to online resources is absolutely crucial to the success of a CS4All student but they also provide an outlet for CS4All to connect our various constituencies with important information about our initiative. Knowing where to go to access the resources that CS4All has across the district and how to continue to make more of the resources available is key to working with CS4All and towards Computer Science for All.
