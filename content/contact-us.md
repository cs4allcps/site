[CS4All](https://chooseyourfuture.cps.edu/computer-science-for-all/) was established within Chicago Public Schools by Brenda Wilkerson in 2013, providing input and inspiration to the CS4All movements around the country. Brenda Wilkerson is Senior Manager at Chicago Public Schools of Computer Science & Information Technology Ed., Office of College and Career Success, Computer Science for All!, and Early College and Career Education. This site is a community resource in support of that effort.
